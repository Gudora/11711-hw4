54,"You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.",0
54,"Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?",0
54,Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!,0
54,And youre my big brother!,0
54,"I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.",0
54,Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.,0

80,Looks like I was second to last.,1
81,"Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.",0

110,I think it has to do with my working late.,0
110,"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",0
110,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",0
110,"Oh, that'd be great!",0
110,"Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.",0
110,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",0
111,Check this out.,0

113,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",1
113,Yeah.,0
113,"My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.",0
113,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.,0
113,"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.",0
114,"Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.",0

116,"Yeah, yeah, that's her.",0
116,But y'know what?,0
116,"Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.",0

116,"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",1
116,No. No. No. She lives on the,0

119,"You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",0

119,And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.,0
119,"Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?",0
119,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?",0
119,"I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.",0
119,"That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",0
119,"I mean really, think about it.",0
119,"Ho-ho, I will.",0

132,Transit Authority?,0
132,"Yes, hello.",0
132,"I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.",0
132,"Hi, here's the deal.",0
132,We lost a carseat on a bus today.,0
132,"It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.",0
132,"Oh, and there was a baby in it.",0
132,He wants to talk to you again.,0
133,Hello.,0
133,Im sorry Im a little late.,0
133,Whoa,1
133,"Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.",0
133,"So to sum up, Im Professor Geller.",0
134,"Good evening, sir.",0
134,My name is Ross Geller.,0
134,I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.,0
134,And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.,0
134,"I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.",0
134,"Man, I wish I was naked.",0
134,"I mean, this-this looks so great.",0
134,That is how God intended it.,0
135,"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!",0
135,"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!",0
135,"Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!",0
135,"Okay, you go!",0
135,My turn? What-what are you talking about?,1
135,"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.",0
135,What?!,1
135,"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.""",0
135,"And he said, ""Laundry?",0
135,Is,0
135,Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.,0
135,"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",0
135,"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.",0
135,What?!,1
135,Mr. Bigot. He tells the most,0
135,All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,0
135,Me and Chandler?!,1
136,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",0
136,"Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?",0
136,I don't know! I didn't come with her!,0
136,All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!,0
136,A test?!!,1
136,Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!,0
137,"Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?",0
137,"Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.",0
137,Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.,1
138,"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.",0
138,I think its best sir.,0
138,But we really do need to find someone up here.,0
138,The work is starting to pile up.,0
138,Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.,0
138,"Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.",0
138,Thats a good one.,0
138,What does a guy have to,0
139,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.",0
139,"Hi, Julie!",0
140,Isnt there a national football league.,0
140,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",0
140,Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,0
140,"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?",0
140,"When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.",0
141,"Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?",0
141,"I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?",0
141,"Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.",0
141,Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.,0
141,Really?,1
141,"Yeah, for you!",0
142,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!",1
142,That's,0
142,"Hey, I've been honing!",0
142,What was with the dishes?,0
142,"Oh, uh..",0
142,I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?,0
142,"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",0
142,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",1
142,Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,0
142,"Great, now he's waving back.",0
142,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy.",0
142,"This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.",0
142,It creeps me out!,0
142,I feel like I can't do stuff!,0
142,What kinda stuff?,0
142,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",0
142,You cook naked?,1
142,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",0
142,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,1
143,Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.,0
143,"Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.",0
143,Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.,0
143,You think you know me so well.,0
143,"Well, dont cha wanna?",0
143,Yeah.,0
143,"Okay, well I do know you.",0
143,Thats what I said.,0
143,Well so?,0
143,I cant.,0
143,I cant.,0
143,"She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.",0
143,"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.",0
144,"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",0
144,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",0
144,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,0
144,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",0
144,Nuh-uh.,0
144,Yuh-huh.,0
144,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?",1
144,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.",0
144,This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?,1
144,No.,0
144,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?",0
144,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my",0
145,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",0
145,That's the rule.,0
145,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",0
145,How'd you get to that?,0
145,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",0
145,You knew about that?,1
145,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.",0
145,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?",0
145,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?",0
145,Yeah,0
145,You think we're ready for something like that?,0
145,Why not?,0
145,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?",0
145,"Why, are you moving out?",1
145,I'm not moving out.,0
145,You'd tell me if you were moving out right,0
145,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",0
145,"Aw, I know all about Kip!",0
145,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",0
145,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",0
145,"Aw, don't do that",0
146,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",0
146,"Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.",0
146,"No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.",0
146,Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.,0
147,Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!,0
147,"Aw forget it, its from",0
147,You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!,0
147,Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.,0
148,"Okay! So, well just stay married.",0
148,"Yes, exactly!",0
148,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!,0
148,"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.",0
148,What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!,1
148,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?",0
148,Really?,0
148,I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!,0
148,Its,0
148,"Ohh, okay, Im sorry.",0
148,Youre right.,0
148,Yknow what?,0
148,Im asking you to do me a favor.,0
148,You are asking me to be your wife!,0
148,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.,0
149,Oh my God!,1
149,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.",0
149,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",0
149,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-",0
149,-leg?,0
149,"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",0
149,You actually broke her watch?,1
149,"Barry, I'm sorry...",0
149,I am so sorry...,0
149,"I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...",0
150,"No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.",0
150,"Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.",0
150,"Okay, okay, bye",0
150,So what are they doing?,0
150,"I dont know, something girlie.",0
150,"Hey, youre early.",0
150,What are you doing with the lamp?,1
150,Im just taking it to be re-wired.,0
150,"Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.",0
150,"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",0
150,Youre disturbing my oboe practice.,0
150,You dont play the oboe!,0
150,I could play the oboe!,0
151,Ohhh! That is soo sweet!,0
151,"Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.",0
151,"All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",0

153,Go!,0
153,"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?",1
153,"I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.",0
153,I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.,0
153,"Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?",1
153,Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?,0

158,You don't trust him?,1
159,I think the check in is that way.,0
159,Ahh.,0

161,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,1
161,I did.,0
161,Oh.,0
161,"Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?",0
161,Sometime?,0
161,Maybe?,0
161,"Yeah, maybe...",0
161,"Okay... okay, maybe I will...",0

162,"Well, youre amazing.",0
162,Oh no-no-no.,0
162,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",1

162,What do you think?,0
162,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,0
163,"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",0
163,"Honey, whats the matter?",0
163,I just saw Janice.,0
164,"Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....",0
164,Wow! This girl is good.,1
164,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",0
164,I like her.,0
164,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?,0
164,"Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.",0
164,Look at you. All jealous.,0
164,"Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more",0

165,"Yes, hello.",0
165,I have a question.,0
165,"Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.",0
165,A beard and a moustache.,0
165,Thank you.,0
165,"No,",0
165,What?! What else did he say?,1
165,"Umm, he said he thought I was funny.",0

165,"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.",0
165,"Ross, I am a human doodle!!",0

165,"And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna",0
165,"Okay, there was",0
166,Come on!,0
166,"Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?",0

167,Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!,1
167,"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?",0
167,So?!,0
167,"Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?",1
167,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!,0
167,"Oh right, right.",0
167,"I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?",0
167,Well usually...yeah!,1
167,"Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.",0
167,"Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.",0
167,Im such a jerk.,0
167,"Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",0
168,Hmmm... this is so nice.,0
168,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",0
168,OK.,0
168,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",0
168,Ohhh!!!!,1
168,"Yes, yes, that's right...",0

172,You owe me 20 bucks.,0
172,Thank you. Thank you so much!,0

198,Its-its too soon.,0

199,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",1
199,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,0
199,But my apartment!,1
199,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,0
199,"Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.",0
199,Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!,0
199,When will that be?,0
199,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",0
200,Hey Ross! The babys kicking!,0

203,See what you did.,0
203,"Yeah, listen...",0

204,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.",0
204,"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",0

204,Boutros Boutros Gali.,0
204,He says he was too.,0
204,Interesting.,0
204,So I was wondering....,0
204,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",0
204,"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.",0

209,Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.,0
209,"But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.",0
209,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,1

216,"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?""",0
216,Yeah that's the same.,0
216,That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,0
216,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?,0
216,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",0
216,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.",0
216,"Y'know, for me anyway.",0
216,"And of course, the Indians.",0
216,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",0
217,"Hi, guys.",0

219,I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.,0
219,Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?,0

229,I'll tell you what.,0
229,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",0
229,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,1
229,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",0
229,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",0
229,"No, no, no.",0
229,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,0

231,"Yeah, thats her.",0
231,Thank you.,0
231,Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!,1
231,Yknow what would work?,0
231,Stop making candy!,0
231,You mean they like you.,0
231,Maybe.,0
231,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?,1
231,"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",0
232,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!",0
232,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",1
232,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!",0
232,Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!,0

233,"Well, I like it. Here you go.",0
233,"All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?",0
233,"Oh, I embarrass you?",1
233,How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?,0
233,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,0
233,Theyre all tourists.,0
233,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",0
233,Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,0
233,Good choice.,0
233,Thanks.,0
233,"Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",0
234,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",1
234,What?,1
234,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.",0
234,"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my",0
234,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",1
234,You don't even know me...,0
234,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.",1
234,What?,1
234,"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.",0
234,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",0
234,"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?",0
234,Oh yeah.,0
235,"Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!",0
235,"Okay, heres what were gonna do.",0
235,"Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.",0
235,You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.,0
235,Okay?,0
235,"All right, here we go.",0
235,Haul ass!!!,0
236,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.",0
236,So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...,0
236,...and live forever as a machine!,0
236,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?",0
236,"You and I, we're interfacing.",0
236,"Yeah, I gotta go.",0
236,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!,0
237,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",0
237,"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.",0
237,See?,0
237,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",0
237,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",0
237,"Oh, I should go, too.",0
237,"Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",0
238,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.",0
238,"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!",0
238,I asked him.,0
238,"He's totally ok with seeing you!"".",0
238,So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!,0
238,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",0
238,Exactly!,0
238,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,0
238,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,",0
238,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",0
238,"Ok, that'll be great!",0
238,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",0
238,That's not what we're gonna do!,0
238,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",0
239,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",0
239,Hello Skidmark.,0
239,"Its a nickname, Ill explain later.",0
239,Its pretty clear.,0
239,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",0
239,Thats why you broke up with me?,1
239,"You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",0
240,Ni-chou chi-ma!,0
240,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",1
241,Hi everyone.,0
241,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",0
241,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.",0
241,"What did, what did he say?",0
241,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.",0
241,"So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.",0
242,"Oh, great!",0
242,"We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.",0
242,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.",0
242,"All I could think of was yknow, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?""",0
242,And did he?,0
242,"Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.",0
242,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",0
242,I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.,0
242,"Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.",0
242,"Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?",0
242,You sound like a guy.,0
242,"No, a guy would be saying, ""Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.""",0
242,Oh my God!,1
242,Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!,0
242,Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!,1
242,"I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.",0
242,Youll have a last kiss.,0
243,Thank you so much for coming back over.,0
243,"Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",0
243,"I know Mona, just hear me out.",0
243,"First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.",0
243,Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.,0
243,Focus.,0
243,"Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are",0
244,All right wheres that turkey!,0
244,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,1
244,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!,0
245,No.,0
245,No!,0
245,"Oh, would you look at that Monica?",0
245,"I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.",0
245,"Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!",0
245,"Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.",0
245,Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!,0
246,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,0
246,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,0
246,"Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.",0
246,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!,0
246,"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",0
246,Or Friday with no two pizzas!,0
246,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.,0
246,No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!,0
246,"All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",0
246,Thats right!,0
246,Cause Im a Tribbiani!,0
246,And this is what we do!,0
246,We can eat!,0
247,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.",1
247,Look at this!,0
247,Oh! You have a window!,1
247,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...,0
247,Oh look! That guy's peeing!,1
247,Hi.,0
247,Hi.,0
248,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",0
248,Okay. Lets use this brush.,0
248,Okay. This stuff?,0
248,Yeah.,0
248,All right.,0
248,"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",0
248,Okay-Dokey,0
249,Where exactly is your zoo?,0
249,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.",0
249,"Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",0
249,Yes.,0
249,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",0
249,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",0
249,Even if he were... cornered?,0
249,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",0
249,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?",0
249,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",0
249,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?",0
249,Otherwise it's just cruel.,0
249,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.",0
249,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",0
249,...He's in.,0
249,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",0
249,You're making a big mistake here.,0
249,"I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.",0
250,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.,0
250,Really helped speed the process along!,0
250,Janice!,1
250,You're not... gone?,1
250,Sid is still in his room.,0

260,"Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.",0
260,I made it in the sixth grade.,0
260,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",0
260,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.",0
260,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.",0
260,"Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.",0
260,Why not?,0
260,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",0
261,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,0

269,Paper cut!,0
269,"Now, have you told anyone else?",0
269,"No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.",0
269,You told me.,1
269,"Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",0
269,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.",1
269,Me too.,0

273,Ill take those to go.  For the kids.,0
273,"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?",0
273,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.",0
273,"But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.",0
273,"Understood. So, whatd you say back then?",0

275,Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,0
275,"Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.",0
275,"Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.",0
275,"All right thats it, school is in session!",0

276,Exactly! Because it's in the past!,0
276,Anybody gonna eat that?,0

277,I know. They were mine.,0
277,"Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!",0
277,"No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",0
277,Thats weird!,0
277,Im wearing his briefs right now.,0
277,Thatskinda hot.,1
278,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,0
278,"Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.",0
278,And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,0
279,"Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",0
279,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.,0
279,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.",0
279,Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!,0
279,I dont think you could ever do that.,0
279,Hey! I,0
279,"Okay, whatever.",0
280,Lusts of the flesh.,0

283,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",0
283,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",0
283,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.,0
283,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",0
283,Pathetic mess?,0
283,"I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.",0
283,"I'm thinkin', cha-ching!",0

284,Really?!,1
284,"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!""",0
284,Oh so-so not really never.,0
284,I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.,0
284,"I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.",0
284,"Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.",0
284,"Oh-ho, and mine!",0
285,No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,0
285,WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.,0
285,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",0
285,"Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",0
285,Chandler?,0
286,I-Im sorry?,0
287,"No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!",0

289,I didnt know he could get me fired!,1
289,What am I going to do?,0
289,"Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.",0
289,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.",0
289,"No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",0
289,Thats not a bad idea.,0
289,"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.",0
289,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.",0
289,"So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?",0

291,Thats right!,0

354,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,0
354,Why? Why cant you go to him?,1

355,"Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.",0

356,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,0
356,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",0

444,"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",0
444,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.",1
444,"I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.",0
444,Right?,0
444,"I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",0

444,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",0
444,You didnt break up with that fireman?,1

444,"Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.",0
444,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.,0
444,Wow!,1
444,"Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",0
444,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?",0
444,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?",0
444,So Its really just about the math.,0
445,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.",0
445,"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",0
445,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!",0
445,"Monica, that was also true an",0

449,"I mean, you know, we've never really talked.",0
449,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",0
449,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",0
449,Really? Me?,1
449,"Oh my god, are you kidding?",1
449,"Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",0
449,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",0
449,Oy.,0
449,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",0
449,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",0
449,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",0

450,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",0
450,"I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",0
450,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,0
450,Maybe it was the guy.,0
450,It was the ring!,0
451,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",0
451,"Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.",0

458,"No, I know! I get it! Its funny!",0

468,"Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",0
468,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.",0
468,We ruined everything.,0
468,Ugh,0
468,"Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!",0
468,"No, what did, that was really sweet.",0
468,And it kinda works out for the best.,0
468,"What do you, what do you mean?",1
468,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!",0

469,"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",1
469,I don't think so!,0

471,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",0
471,"I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.",0
471,"Ohh, thats too bad!",0
471,"No, I-Im saying I liked her.",0
471,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",0
471,"Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.",0

471,Fights over!,0
472,"Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?",0
472,"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.",1
472,Hi guys!,0
472,Hey!,0
472,What are you up too?,0
472,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.",0
472,"Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",0
472,"Yeah, Big Brother.",0
472,Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,0
472,"Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",0
472,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,0
472,Eh,0

473,Can you believe that?!,1
473,Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!,1
473,"Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.",0
473,"No, no ""How you doing?"" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!",0
473,The nerve huh?,0
473,Yeah!,0

475,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",0
475,"All right, all right, you're right",0
475,What the hell are you cooking!,1
476,Oh my God! How did you get back here?!,1
476,"Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?",1
476,We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.,0
476,Thats not mine.,0
476,Yes it is.,0
476,How do you know?,0
476,"The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, ""Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica.""",0
476,"Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",0
476,"Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.",0
476,Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!,0
476,Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.,0
476,Theres a reset button?!,1

477,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",0
477,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.,0
477,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",0
477,Nngghhh!!!!!!!,0
477,"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",0

480,"""Benefits lapsed.""",0
480,Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,0
480,"Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.",0
480,Let me see that!,1
480,All right.,0
480,"Oh, I cant believe this!",1
480,This sucks!,0
480,"When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?",0
480,And it wouldnt matter.,0
480,Now I gotta be careful?,0
480,"Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",0
480,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.",0
480,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",0
480,look both ways before you cross the street.,0
481,I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!,1
482,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.",0
482,"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.",0
482,Do you know anything about women?,0
482,No.,0

487,"Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",0
487,Whats the other one?,0
487,"I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.",0
487,"Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.",0
487,Oh thats right.,0
487,Youre the talker.,0
487,"Anyway uh, great idea!",0
487,"Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",0
487,"Oh, we have some",0

488,"Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.",0
489,"Yeah, what town are we near?",0

489,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?,0
490,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",0
490,"Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?",0
490,"I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",0
490,"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?",0
490,Okay!,0
490,"Yeah, no they dont do that.",0
490,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",0
490,Who?,0
490,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?,0
490,"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",0
490,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",0
490,But if...,0
490,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.",0
490,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",0
490,So the going for help went well?,0
491,"Im telling you man, I saw it.",0
491,"Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.",0
491,"Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?",0
492,I know.,0
492,Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.,0
492,"Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.",0
492,Chandler!,1
492,What is the matter with your face?!,1
492,"I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!""",0
492,Hey!,0
492,Dont laugh at him!,0
492,Hes,0
493,Were gonna find love!,0
493,Definitely!,0
493,"Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.",0
493,Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!,0
493,It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.,0
493,What do you mean?,0
493,"Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.",0
493,You mean a backup?,0
493,Exactly!,0
493,"Yeah, yeah I got that.",0

495,Wo-women? You mean like old women?,0
495,"Well kinda old, like 30.",0
495,Oh.,0

497,That could be a four or a five. It's your call.,0
497,It's a four.,0
497,I think so too.,0
498,Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.,0
498,"Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.",0
498,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",0
498,Is there anything we can do for you?,0
498,"No just, nobody press on my stomach.",0
498,You can keep those pants by the way.,0

499,Oh my God!,1
499,"Of course, of course.",0
499,"Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?",0

499,Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?,0
499,"Well, umm, not much.",0
499,"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?",0
499,"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",0
499,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?",0
499,Nothing..Why?,0
499,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",0
499,Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.,0
499,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,0
499,"Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",0
500,"Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.",0
500,"Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.",0
500,"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",0
500,"Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",0
500,No.,0
500,"I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.",0
500,"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",0
500,"God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",0
500,"Its just changed, everything.",0

504,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",0
504,That's funny. Who are they?,0
504,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",0

520,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",0

522,"Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?",0
522,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!,0
523,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,0
523,So thats the only reason she could be here huh?,0
523,It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a,0
523,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",0
523,"I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.",0

524,"Otherwise, youre just mean!",0
524,"So, just tell me the truth!",0
524,"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.",0
524,My Father is Chuck Magioni?,1
524,"No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!",0
524,"And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.",0
524,Oh.,0
524,"But umm, youre right.",0
524,I think that a person should know where they come from.,0
524,"Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.",0
524,Im your mother.,0
524,Heh?,1
524,"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...",0

525,"Umm, were there any questions?",0
525,About paleontology.,0
525,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",0
525,"Obviously, I screwed up.",0
525,But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.,0
525,So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,0
525,Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am,0
525,"Well, hello Rachel!",1
526,"Where you going, Joe?",0
526,For a walk.,0
526,Oh. You mind if I join you?,0
526,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",0
526,Your thoughts? Plural?,1
526,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!",0
526,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",0
526,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??,0
526,You guys are killing me!,0
526,She's forbidden fruit!,0
526,"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",0
526,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?,0
526,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",0
526,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,0
526,Great novels?,1
526,Fine ... mediocre porn,0
527,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.",0
527,"Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",0
527,Thats kinda sad.,0
527,"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,",0
527,Got it!,0
527,Lets roll!,0
527,"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?",0

529,"Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?",0
529,"I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",0
530,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",1
530,"Look, you and I went to different high schools...",0
530,"Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.",0
530,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.",0
530,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,0
530,They had to have that specially made?!,1
530,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,0
530,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",1
530,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.",1
530,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.,0
530,I-I owe her this.,0
530,I never let her eat.,0
530,"Oh, you go out with him.",0
530,"Oh, really?!",1
530,"Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?",0
530,Ill try.,0
531,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.",0
531,"Yeah, yeah, okay.",0
531,"Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..",0
531,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!",0
531,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know",0
532,"Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.",0
532,Yeah but,0
532,"Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",0
532,Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!,0
532,"Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!",0
532,"Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!",0
532,"Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?",0
532,Sure!,0

534,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",0
535,"So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.",0
535,Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.,0
535,"Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.",0
535,What do you mean?,1
535,Carol our sex life isits just not working,0

552,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,0
552,Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,1
552,"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?",0
552,"Ummmmmmmm, no.",0
552,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!,0
552,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.",0
553,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.",0

555,"Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",0
555,Oh my god.,1

555,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",0
555,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?",0
555,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",0

556,"Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!",0
556,"Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!",0

588,"Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?",0

589,"Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.",0
589,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",0
589,"This doesnt mean anything, does it?",0
590,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?,0
590,That is true.,0
590,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",0
590,"Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.",0
590,"Joey, you know you dont actually have one.",0
590,Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!,0

590,"All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.",0
590,"What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!",0
590,"The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!",0
590,But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!,0
590,"Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.",0
590,"But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",0
590,I think thats gum.,0
590,Im pretty sure its gun.,0
590,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.",0
590,"A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",0
590,That was the only way I could get him to,0
590,Hi! How are the Gellers?,0
590,Dont call us that!,0
590,The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,0

591,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,1
591,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?",0
591,"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.",0
591,"Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.",0
591,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,0
591,Stop it!,0
591,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.",0
591,"I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.",0
591,Yeah?,0
592,Of course he is!,0
592,"What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?",0
592,What kind of father do you think I am?,0
592,"All right, sorry.",0
592,I gotta go make a fake Ben.,0
593,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",1
593,"Well, either that or uh",0
593,Joey!!,0
593,Yeah?,0
593,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,0
593,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",0
593,"Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!",0
593,They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!,0

595,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.",0
595,"Yeah, isn't he?",0
595,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",0
595,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.,0
595,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,1
595,Huh. That's nice.,0
596,"and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for",0
596,Eight whole days.,0
596,"Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",0
596,Awesome!,0
596,Yeah?,1
596,My favorite part was when,0
596,The Armadillo was actually not so,0

597,"Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.",1
597,What?,0
597,"Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?",1
597,Why would you say that?,0
597,Cause youre still into Monica.,0
597,"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...",0
597,Youre good. Youre good!,0
597,"Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.",0
597,"Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?",0
597,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",0
597,Thanks a lot.,0
597,"No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.",0
598,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",0
598,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",0
598,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",0
598,"Oh, thanks, sweetie.",0
598,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.,0
598,Really?,1
598,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?,0
598,"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",0
598,Can't wait.,0
599,Do I know you?,1
599,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",1
599,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.",0
599,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.,1
599,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.",0
599,"Uh, wait, backstage?",1

599,"Look, you guys wanna meet the group?",0
599,Come on.,0
599,"So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?",1
600,Do you have any respect for your body?,0
600,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?,0
600,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",0
600,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",0
600,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.",0
600,Really?,1
600,He does?,1
600,"Hey, buddy, what's up!",0
600,"Oh, she told you about that, huh.",1
600,"Well, yeah, I have one now and then.",0
600,"Well, yeah, now.",0
600,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.",0
600,"Well, okay, thanks!",0
600,"God, he's good.",0
600,If only he were a woman.,0
600,Yeah.,0
601,"Oh, look look look.",1
601,The last candle's about to burn out.,0

601,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",0
602,"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",0
603,You blew them away!,0
603,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!",0
603,"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?",0
603,I was,1
603,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!",0
603,Oh my God!  I'm your,1
603,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!,0
603,"Look, I took it too far!",0
604,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red.",0

604,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.,0
604,"To the left, to the left- aww!",0
604,Ohhh... I'm fine.,0
605,Hey!,0
605,Please tell me you got the message!,0
605,What message?,0
605,"The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.",0
605,What?! Its 6 oclock!,1
605,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!",0
605,"I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!",0
605,I went to Rosss!,0
605,I went to the coffeehouse!,0
605,I went to any place that they made sandwiches!,0
606,"Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.",0
606,Thats what you think.,0
606,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?",0
606,"Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",0
606,What was her name?,0
606,Nestley Toulouse.,0
606,Nestlé Toll House?,0
606,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",0
606,Yes!!  Oh.,1
606,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,0
606,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!,0
607,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",0
607,Absolutely!,0
607,I am so on board!,0
607,Rachel didn't you just light that?,0
607,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.",0
607,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.,0
607,"Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like",0
607,Tell me about it!,0
607,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,0
607,It does sound appealing.,0
607,"Oh, I never could do it.",0
607,Oh but you could.,0
607,You can.,0
607,Absolutely!,0
607,We can help each other out!,0
607,We can get--what are those--those patches!,0
607,We could be like the Patch Sisters!,0
607,"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!",0
607,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!,0
607,My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,0
607,Okay then!,0
608,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",0
608,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",0
608,Nooo..,0
608,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",0
608,It's worse than the thumb!,0
608,"Hey, this is so unfair!",0
608,"Oh, why is it unfair?",1
608,So I have a flaw!,0
608,Big deal!,0
608,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,0
608,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",0
608,"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",0
608,"I mean, what the hell is that thing?",0
608,"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",0
608,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,0
608,"Well, I-I could live without it.",0
608,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",0
608,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",0
608,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",0
608,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",0
608,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",0
608,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.",0
608,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",0
609,Awww! Mel Torme died.,0
609,"Joey, that papers like a year old!",0
609,Aw! Does that mean the,0
609,Hey.,0
609,Hey.,0
610,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,0
610,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",0
610,Probably?,0
610,"Yeah, I don't like that word.",0
610,Kind of what probably really means.,0
610,"Yeah, uh-huh.",0
610,"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?",0
610,"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",0
610,You gotta take care of yourselves!,0
610,In,0
610,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",0
611,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.,0
611,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?,0
612,Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?,0
612,"Oh, Im fine.",0
612,"Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.",0
612,"Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.",0
612,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",0
612,"Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!",0
612,"Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.",0
612,Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.,0
612,"Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.",0
613,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.",0
614,Hey. Whos that?,0
614,New people.,0
614,What happened to the Disgustingtons?,0
614,Theyre having their baby!,0
614,Its not fair Ross we got here first!,0
614,Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.,0
614,Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,0
614,"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?",1
615,Phoebe?,0
615,Yeah?,0
615,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",1
615,"Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.",0
615,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",0
615,I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.,0
615,"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",0
615,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",0
615,Yeah.,0
615,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",0
615,Really?! So this has happened to you?,1
615,Oh absolutely yeah!,0
615,"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",0
615,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.",0
615,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a",0
616,Ugh!,0
616,I dont know what Im going to do!,0
616,I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!,0
616,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?",0
616,Hey guys!,0
616,Hey!,0
616,Hey,0
616,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!",0
616,And the guys from work had a blast.,0
616,"Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.",0
616,Yeah!,0
616,"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so",1
616,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!",0
616,"Yeah, right!",0
616,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those",0
616,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",1
616,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",1
616,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",0
616,"So you might say, its a magic ring.",0
617,OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!,1
618,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,0
618,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",0
618,"Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her",0
618,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,0
618,"Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her",0
618,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,0
618,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",0
618,Yeah well we should order some food then.,0
618,"No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well",0
618,That sounds fair.,0
618,Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street,0
618,Ah yeahwait a second now!,0
618,Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,0
618,I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,0
618,"Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.",0
618,"All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.",0
618,So lets decide on the spending limit,0
618,"Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?",0
618,I was thinking more like a hundred.,0
618,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,0
619,"Hi, again.",0
619,Hey!,0
619,Hey!,0
619,"Thank you soo, much.",0
619,"Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",0
619,You want some help with that?,0
619,"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!",0
619,Whoa! Are you okay?,1
619,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",1
619,Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.,0
619,"Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.",0
619,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,0
619,Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.,1
619,What do you mean?,0
620,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.,0
621,Oh!,1
621,"Hey, somebody left their keys.",0
621,"Ooohh, to a Porsche!",1
621,"Hey Gunther, these yours?",0
621,"Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!",0
621,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?,0
621,"Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?",0
621,Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!,1
621,You left a shoe here?!,1
621,"Well, I didnt realize until I got home.",0
621,I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!,0
621,Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.,0
621,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.",0
621,Great! Thanks.,0
622,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",0
622,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?",0
622,We have a good time.,0
622,"We laugh, we play.",0
622,It's like we're father and son.,0
622,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.",0
622,"Oh, this is so cute.",0
622,"Oh, I got that for him.",0
622,My mommies love me. That's clever.,0
622,Hello?,0
622,"Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!",0
622,Uh huh?,0
622,Uh huh?,0
622,"Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.",0
622,See ya then.,0
622,Bye.,0
622,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?",1
622,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",0
623,Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!,0
623,Thanks Monica!,0
623,Does that smell bother you?,0
623,"What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",1
623,"Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.",0
623,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",0
623,Okay!,0

623,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.",0
623,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!,1
623,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.",0
623,"No-no, it was the candles.",0
623,Its very not good leaving candles unattended.,0
623,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.",0
623,"Well, I have to go now.",0
624,Joey proposed to me.,1
625,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,1
625,"Well, I-I said yes.",0
625,What?!,1
625,Are you crazy?,0
625,You just had Ross’s baby!,0
625,It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,0
625,"No, it’s worse than that.",0
625,It’s wrong.,0
625,It’s… It is bigger than  mine!,1
625,I know.,0
625,You can’t marry him!,0
625,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,0
625,Well do you love him?,0
625,Sure.,0
625,Sure?,0
625,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",0
625,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",0
625,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",0
626,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,0
626,Here comes the bride.,0
626,Oh my God Monica!,1
626,I wanna wear this everyday.,0
626,You look so beautiful.,0
626,Im so happy for me.,0
626,Hello?,0
626,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?,0
626,"Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.",0
626,Damnit!,0
627,"I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",0
627,Fine.,0
627,"Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",0
627,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!,0
627,"No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I",0
627,"Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!",0
627,And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!,0
627,Crap!!,0
627,I gotta go!,0
628,Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,1
628,No.,0
628,Me neither! We have to get in!,1
628,Just act like you belong.,0
628,Oh my God! Oranges!,1
628,Shh!  Nice to see you again.,0
628,"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?",0
628,"Yes, of course.",0
628,"Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.",0
628,"Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.",0
629,Okay!,0
629,Yknow what?,0
629,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.,0
629,All I really needed was a plan.,0
629,See I wanna have three kids,0
629,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",0
629,As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.,0
630,You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!,0
630,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",0
630,Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!,0
630,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,0
630,I dont know.,0
630,Why am I not surprised?,0
630,Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!,0
630,I dont think you have much choice.,0
630,Well well see!,0
630,Bye-bye!,0
630,Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?,0
630,Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .,0
631,Dad?,0
631,Im here!,0
631,Hey!,1
631,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.",0
631,"Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.",0
631,"Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",0
631,Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,0
631,Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.,0
631,"Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories",0
631,"Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven",0
631,I used to,0
631,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",0
631,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a",0
632,"Ok, got the vent open.",0
632,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",0
632,"Ben, you ready?",0
632,"All right, gimme your foot.",0
632,"Ok, on three, Ben.",0
632,"One, two, three.",0
632,"Ok, That's it, Ben.",0
632,What do you see?,0
632,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.",0
632,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!",1
632,Wait! You forgot your legs!,1
633,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.",0
633,Thank you.,0
633,Filing system?,0
633,Oh-oh!,1
633,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?,0
633,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,0
633,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",0
633,I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,0
633,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",0
633,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost,0
633,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",0
633,"Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",0
633,"Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",0
633,"Yes, I realize that",0
633,"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",0
633,I love working with designers!,0
633,"With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?",0
634,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",0
634,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,0
635,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",0
635,I do?,1
635,"Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.",0
635,Okay.,0
635,Or not.,0
636,Where's Chandler?,0
636,Here I am.,0
636,Wash your hands!!!,0
636,How did youknow?,1
636,Hey! What's she doing back here?,1
636,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",0
636,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",0
637,What happened in Atlantic City?!,1
637,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar",0
637,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",0
637,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?",0
637,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",0
637,"Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.",0
637,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,1
637,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",0
637,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard",0
637,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",0
637,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",0
638,"So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",0
638,Of course I am!,0
638,"Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.",0
638,"Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.",0
638,And-and then guess what?,0
638,The babys coming and I dont know what to do.,0
638,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",0
638,"No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.",0
638,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,0
638,Im going to the bathroom.,0
638,Okay.,0
638,Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.,0
638,It,0
638,Hey!,0
638,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?,1
638,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.,0
638,Not if you were here.,0
639,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",0
639,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!,0
639,I hope its you.,0
639,Me too!,0
639,"First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me",0
639,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",0
639,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",0
639,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",0
639,Yes!!! Oh!!,0
639,Hypothetically!,0
639,Still.,0
639,If Phoebe were my maid of honor,0
639,"Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",0
639,Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.,0
639,"Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?",0
639,"Well thats the best part. Umm,",0
639,Wh-why is that the best part?,1
639,Because then I dont have to!,0
639,Well of,0
639,Im really not deciding!,0
639,Fine!,0
639,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!",0
640,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",0
641,It's not just the drum noise.,0
641,"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",0
641,"Oh god, my eye!""",0
641,"I mean, it is so annoying.",0
641,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",0
641,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",1
641,Maybe on some level.,0
642,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,1
642,"No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.",0
642,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.",0
642,"And, a brownie!",0
642,"Well, half a brownie.",0
642,"Actually, its just bag.",0
642,Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so,0
642,Oh man!,0
642,This is so great!,0
642,I actually feel like Im going on a real date!,0
642,"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.",0
642,"Hey come on now, this is a real date.",0
642,"Uh, sonice place you got here.",0
642,"Foosball, huh?",1
642,Pizza box.,0
642,"Oh, a subscription to",1
642,"Yeah, actually thats my roommates.",0
642,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,0
642,"Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.",0
642,"Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?",0
642,Hm-mmm,0
642,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",0
642,"Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.",0
642,"No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",0
643,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,0
643,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.",0
643,"Ha. Ha, ha.",0
643,What?,0
643,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.",0

644,He didn't get the goggles!,1
644,"Well,sounds like you two have issues.",0
644,"Goodbye, baby.",0
644,"Ciao, bela.",0
644,Do they wait for me to do this?,0
644,So are you gonna tell him?,0
644,Why would I tell him?,0
644,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.",0
644,What are you guys doing here?,0
644,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,1
644,...What did I ask?,0
645,God. I feel violated.,0
645,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",0
645,"Ross, ten o'clock.",0
645,Is it? Feels like two.,0
645,"No,",0
645,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",0
645,Oh. Hel-lo!,0
645,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",0
645,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",0
645,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",0
645,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",0
645,"Oh please, could she",0
645,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,0
645,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",0
645,You could do that!,0
645,You think?,1
646,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",0
646,OK.,0
646,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",0
646,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",0
646,"Last time I do that, I promise.",0
647,"I am so, so, so, so sorry!",0
647,Uh-huh.,0
647,"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!",0
647,"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!",0
647,"Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?",0

648,I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.,0
648,I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.,0
648,For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.,0
648,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.",0
648,Wow!,1
648,What?,1
648,"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.",0
648,Really?,1

648,Shut the book!,0
648,Lets also get a hot plate!,0
649,"Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends",0
650,Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?,0
650,"Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.",0
650,I do the same thing.,0
650,Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25,0
650,Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.,0
650,So when are you getting married?,0
650,Oh May 15,0
650,Oooh its getting close!,0
650,"So uh, whos your photographer?",0

650,The best man? Wow!,1
650,"I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!",0
650,"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.",0

650,"Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!",0
650,Oh yknow what?,0
650,Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.,0
650,This place is so overpriced.,0
650,"So, does this  come in another color or",0
651,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.",0
651,It was unbelievable!,1
651,"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",0
651,So have you called her yet?,0
651,Let her know I like her?,0
651,"What are you, insane?",0
651,It's the next day!,0
651,How needy do I want to seem?,0
651,"I'm right, right?",0
651,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",0
651,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,1
651,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",0
651,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",0
651,Her answer machine?,0
651,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",0
651,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",0
651,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",0
651,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",1
651,"Okay, okay, what's going on?",0
651,"Okay, they're just talking...",0
651,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",0
652,"So, um, what do you do for a living?",0
652,"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.",0
652,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.,0
652,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,0
652,Now that is funny.,0
652,"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?",0
652,"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",0
652,I guess.,0
652,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,0
652,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.",0
652,Come on.,0
652,These people'll scooch down.,0
652,"You guys'll scooch, won't you?",0

652,"And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!",0
653,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?",0
653,That's patio furniture!,1
653,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",0
653,What about the birds?,0
653,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",0
653,You pick one.,0
653,"All right, how about the ladybugs?",0
653,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!",0
653,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",0
653,"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",0
654,Bijan for men?,0
654,Bijan for men?,0
654,"Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",0
654,"Oh, actually I sorta have plans.",0
654,"Ready, Annabelle?",0
654,You bet.  Maybe some other time?,0
654,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!",0
655,That was amazing!,0
655,Phoebe and Gary are,0
655,That was amazing.,0
655,We are the hottest! Huh?,0
655,"No, you're the best.",0
655,"No, you're the best.",0
655,"No, you're the best.",0
655,I,0
655,Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?,0
655,Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?,0
656,So what are you gonna do?,0
656,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",0
656,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",0
656,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?",0
656,"Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",0
656,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,0
656,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",0
656,Why? What happened to him?,0
656,"Nothing, hes just really believes in that.",0
657,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.,0
657,Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.,0
657,"Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.",0
657,"Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.",0
657,"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?""",1
657,"Um-hmm, five actually.",0

666,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.",0
666,"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.",0

758,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",0
758,That does not sound stupid to me.,0
758,"You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?",0

782,"What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",1

783,"Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.",0
783,"Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.",1
783,I can't believe you married him.,1
783,But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a,0
783,So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,0
783,It's over! You,0
783,How can I?,1
783,"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",0
783,How can I accept that...,0
783,I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,0
783,Kiss me.,0
783,What?,1
784,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",0

784,I'd like to propose a toast.,0
784,"Little toast here, ding ding.",0
784,"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.",0
784,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?",0
784,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.,0
784,That's so sweet.,0
784,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",0
784,And a crappy New Year.,0
784,"Here, here!",0

785,Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!,0
785,Thats all!,0
785,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.,0
785,"Please, promise me that youll tell her that.",0
785,"All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!",0

787,You fell asleep?,1
787,"But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?",0
787,Irony?,1
787,"Not a fan, alright .",0
787,"See, here’s  the thing.",0
787,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.,0
787,"See, me, I  love Tulsa!",0

788,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",0
788,Oh. Thanks.,0
788,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing",0
788,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.",0
788,I just can't believe you're in here.,1
788,"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?",0

830,And shame on you!,0
830,And shame on all of you!,0
830,Youre disgusting!,0
830,Especially you  with that!,0
831,Hey!,0
831,Hi Pheebs!,0
831,Are you moving out?,0
831,"No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.",0
831,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?",0
831,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.",0
831,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,",0
831,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...",0
831,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.",0
831,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.",0
831,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",1
831,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies",0
831,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.",1
831,Which proves that I never lie.,0
831,I guess you don't.,0
831,Paolo made a pass at me.,0
832,"Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",0
832,Im not freaking out.,0
832,Why would I be freaking out?,0
832,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.",0
832,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",0
832,"I mean, whats the harm in that?",0
832,Right here!,0
832,"Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",0
832,Phoebe and Rachel!,0
832,"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",0
832,"It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.",0
832,Okay.,0
832,Really?,0
832,"Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready",0
832,I know! I know.,0
832,Okay.,0
832,Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.,0
832,"Hey, did she buy it?",0
832,Totally.,0
832,So did Heldi show you the place?,0
832,"Yeah, its beautiful.",0
832,I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!,0
832,I know.,0
833,"Okay look, I have an idea.",0
833,"Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.",0
833,And then whoever does gets the phone.,0
833,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",0
833,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",0
833,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",0
833,Did I use that already today? Im sorry.,0
833,Joe.,0
833,"Oh, I win! Hes got",0
833,So you dont know thats,0
833,His new girlfriend!,1
834,I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,1
834,"I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.",0
834,Shes saving the rest for her divorce.,0
834,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to,0
834,Well what happened at dinner?,0
834,My parents spent the money for our wedding!,0
834,My God! What did you order?!,1
834,"Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",0
834,"Honey, its gonna be okay.",0
834,No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,0
834,"No, yknow what?",0
834,Its gonna be okay.,0
834,I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.,0
834,Yknow?,0
834,"And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",0
835,"Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.",0
835,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.",0
835,"Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.",0
835,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.,0
835,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.",0
835,"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.",0
835,"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!""",0
835,"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.",0
835,Im Ross!,0
835,"Im divorced, and I have a kid!",0
835,Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!,0
835,"Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.",0
835,"All right, there you go!",0
835,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",0
835,"Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.",0
835,"Okay, good-good for you.",0
835,"Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!",0
835,"Wow, Rhonda.",1
835,Im Scott.,0
835,"Yeah, okay, Scott!",0
835,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.,0
836,So thanks for the warm welcome.,0
836,"Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.",0
836,I hope you do too.,0
836,"Now, lets go out there and get em!",0
836,"And remember, there is no I in team.",0
836,"Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody",0

837,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,0
837,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",0
837,They're gonna call her Chandler.,0
837,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",0
837,Works on you.,0
838,"Oh, that is so sweet.",0
838,"No, no, ok, you hang up.",0
838,"Ok, ok, one, two, three.",0

840,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!",0
840,Really? That's great!,0
840,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her",0
840,(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of,0
840,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,",0
840,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.",0
840,Ben is way cuter than that kid.,0
840,"I mean look at him, look at you,",0
840,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",0
840,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",0
840,I look more like him than you do!,0
840,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.",0
841,That really was some of your best work.,0
841,"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.",0
841,I have to be up in seven minutes.,0
841,"Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes",0
841,Really?!,1
841,Do you wanna?,0
841,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!,0
842,Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.,0
842,Boyfriend?,1
842,No.,0
842,Im Joey.,0
842,Kristen.,0
842,"Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?",0
842,Kristen.,0

842,Yeah!,0
842,Right down there.,0

842,"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?",0
842,"Oh I, I have plans tonight.",0
842,But how about tomorrow?,0
842,"Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?",0
842,"You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.",0
842,"Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.",0
843,Hey.,0
843,"Listen, um...",0
843,I'm sorry.,0
843,": Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'",0
843,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!",0
843,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.",0
843,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?",0
843,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.",0
843,"You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.",0
844,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.",0
844,"Oh, hello liar.",0
844,"Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.",0
844,I couldve been killed I hope you know!,0
844,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were",0
844,"Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.",0
844,Phoebe.,0
844,What?!  What the hell?!,0
844,"All right, yknow what?",0
844,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.",0
844,What?! Why?!,1
844,"Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar",0
844,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",0
844,Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.,0
844,Okay Ross!  Please dont die!,0
845,How could you have kept all of this from me?,0
845,"I was going to tell you, but",0
845,But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,0
845,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?,0
845,Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.,0
845,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.",0
846,Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!,0
846,"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",0
846,"Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.",0
846,"Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",0
846,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.,0
846,"Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.",0
846,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,1
846,That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.,0
847,Hi.,0
847,"Hey man, how did the audition go?",0
847,Estelle said I didn't get it.,0
847,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!,1
847,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.",0
848,No!,1
848,"For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.",0
848,"No, from now on, Im staying in one place.",0
848,Right here.,0
848,"Well, its getting late.",0
848,"Yeah, were gonna go.",0
848,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",0
848,"Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",0
848,"Yeah, its a very large plane.",0
848,Thats cool.,0
848,"But, well stay here with you.",0
848,"Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.",0
849,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",1
849,Theyre not a couple!,1
849,"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",0
849,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",0
849,Oh yeah!,0
849,"Well okay, so then youre fine.",0
849,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,0
849,Okay?,0
849,So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,0
849,"Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.",0
849,Really?,1
849,"Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",0
849,No.,0
849,Noooo!!,0
850,"Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!",1
850,"Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.",0
850,"Wait a second! So, whats new with you?",1
850,"Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.",0
851,And your breasts! Hmm!!!,1
851,Okay.,0
851,"Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.",0
851,"But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.",0
851,"So, why dont we just start over okay?",0
851,And you can just tell me about yourself.,0
851,All right.,0
851,Okay.,0
851,"I write erotic novels, for children.",0
851,What?!,1
851,Theyre wildly unpopular.,0
851,Oh my God!,0
851,"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.",0
851,Wow! You do?,1
851,"Yeah,  a Pretty Huge",0
851,All right.,0
852,"So, uh, how's she doing?",0
852,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,0
852,"How-how are you, Mom?",0
852,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?",0
852,What?,1
852,What's different?,1
852,Nothing.,0
852,"Oh, maybe that's it.",0
852,"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",0
852,"Okay, relax, relax.",0
852,"We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",0
852,Oh God!,1
852,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,0
852,Oh!,1
852,"...Yeah, they were gross.",0
852,"Oh, you know what I loved?",0
852,Her Sweet 'n' Los.,0
852,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.,0
852,"Not just restaurants, from our house.",0
853,Maybe.,0
853,You can't!,1
853,Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.,1
853,In the hall.,0
854,"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",0
854,But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,0
854,"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",0
854,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",0
854,That's a good one!,0
854,"Hey, Joe.",0
854,"Dad, Ronni's here.",0
854,Huh?,1
855,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.",0
855,Anything at all.,0
855,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.,0
855,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.",0
855,Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!,0
856,"Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.",0
856,Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!,0
856,Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?,0
856,Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A,0
856,"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.",0
856,"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?",0
856,"Okay, youre fine.",0
857,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!",1
857,Youll see.,0
857,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",0
857,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",0
857,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.",0
857,"But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.",0
857,"Really, its fine, whatever you want.",0
857,Its perfect.,0
857,"And, I dont know, if it starts to rain",0
857,Well then well get wet.,0
857,Ohh. And I dont even have a date.,0
858,Coming.,0
858,I have a bone to pick with you.,0
858,Uh-oh.,0
858,Yes! Ben learned a little trick.,0
858,Oh yeah? Did he pull the old,1
858,Thats right! Thats right!,0
858,Oh that.,0
858,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!,0
859,Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!,0
859,Okay.,0
859,"And if it were true, how",0
859,Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.,0
860,Mark's a genius!,1
860,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,1
860,"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",0
860,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",0
860,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,0
860,What am I going to do?,0
860,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",0
860,"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",0
860,I don't know you guys.,0
860,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.",0
860,"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",0
860,"And before you know it, she's with him.",0
860,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",0
860,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",0
860,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'",0
860,"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'",0
860,"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",0
860,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,0
861,"This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.",0
861,Great. Great.,0
861,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.",0
861,Ill be there.,0
861,"Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",0
861,"Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!",0
861,Okay! Well need a six-pack of,0
861,"Hey guys, what are you doing?",0
862,"Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.",0
862,"Oh, come on!",0
862,"Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.",0
862,"Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.",0
862,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too.",0
862,"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.",0
862,"And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.",0
862,What do ya say? What do ya say?,0
862,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.",0
862,"But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.",0
862,I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!,0
863,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.",0
863,I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!,1
863,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...",0
863,What's that supposed to mean?,1
863,Nothing! It's an expression.,0
863,No it's not.,0
863,Don't listen to your mother.,0
863,"You're independent, and you always have been!",0
863,"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",0
863,"And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",0
864,PBS Telethon.,0

864,I,0
864,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what",1
864,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not",0
865,What kind of problem?,1
865,"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",0
865,Oh my God!,1
865,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,0
865,"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",0
865,I don't wanna give up the bag.,0
865,I don't have to give up the bag!,0
865,Do I Rach?,0
865,"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",0
865,"Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it",0
865,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,0
865,I can't believe I'm hearing this!,0
865,Wait a minute!,0
865,Wait a minute!,0
865,"I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.",0
865,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets.",0
866,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.,0
866,"Okay, great.",0
866,They say he's only got half a tank left.,0
866,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,1
866,We're switching rooms again.,0
866,What? Why?,1
866,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",0
866,Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.,0
866,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",0
866,Uh-huh.,0
866,Chandler!,0
867,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!,0
867,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!,0
867,"Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?",1
868,Hey!,0
868,"Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.",1
868,"Oh, I wouldnt miss this.",0
868,"Well, Im very glad youre here.",0
868,"Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!",0
869,Hey!,0
869,Hey-hey.,0
869,So are guys doing okay?,0
869,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.",0
870,Do you have a minute?,0
870,"Well yeah, sure, whats up?",0
870,I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.,0
871,Oh really?!,1
871,Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?,0
871,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?",0
872,But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.,0
873,Whys that?,0
874,I dont think I should say.,0
874,"Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.",0
874,Okay.,0
874,Kay.,0
874,Well,0
874,Yeah.,0
874,Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.,0

875,"Great! All right, so Ill call you later.",0
875,Great!,0
875,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,1
875,That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.,0
875,"Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",1
875,"No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",0
875,What?,1
875,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,0
875,Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!,1
875,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,1
875,"Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",0
875,What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.,0
875,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",0
875,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.",0
875,You got all that from the back of her head?,1
875,"All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",0
875,Whos Elaine?,0
876,Can you people not see me?!,0
876,"So, will you talk to him?",0
876,I dont know Rach.,0
876,"Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free",0
876,One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!,0
877,Hey!,0
877,Hi!,0
877,"Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?",0
877,We need a porn break.,0
877,"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",0
877,"Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?",0
877,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.,0
877,"Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.",0
877,Hey!,0
877,Hi!,0
877,"Well, what-what cha got there?",0
877,"Oh this, well Im glad you asked.",0
877,"Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?",0
877,Ahh!,0
877,"Now, I know what youre thinking",0
877,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?,0
877,"Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?",1
877,No!,0
877,"Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",0
877,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",0
877,Whats the second part of your plan?,0
878,Yes thats right.,0
878,Why?,1
878,"I tired attacking two women, did not work.",0
878,What?!,1
878,"No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.",0
878,"In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",0
878,"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!",0
878,"Oh, no!",1
878,No-no!,1
878,"No, I tired!",1
878,But I couldnt.,0
878,Thats why Im here.,0
878,Maybe we could attack them together?,0
878,That-thats a no.,0
879,"What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!",0
879,"Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!",0
879,I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,0
879,"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",0
879,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",0
879,No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.,0
879,I like that.,0
879,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.",0
879,Huh?,0
879,One swift kick and hell back off.,0
879,"All right, bad ankle, got it!",0
879,"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.",0
879,Yeah.,0
879,"And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.",0
879,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",0
879,"And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.",0
879,"But-but, Liams on my team.",0
879,I dont care! You just get him!,0
879,"Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!",0
879,The Red Ross! Okay.,0
880,Oh!  Oh by the way?,0
880,Uh-hmm.,0
880,James Brolin?,0
880,"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.",0
880,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.,0
880,Really?!,1
881,Hello?,0
881,"Hello, is Ross there?",0
881,"Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?",0
881,"Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.",0
881,Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!,1
882,"Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!",0
882,Oh!  Shes growing inside you.,0
882,Whoa!!,1

883,And people say you dont pay attention.,0
883,"No, this is a much better job.",0
883,Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.,0
883,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,1
883,Thats what I do now.,0
883,"Hey Joey, come taste this.",0
883,What is it?,0
883,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!,0
883,You cooked him?,1
883,No.,0
883,"He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.",0
883,"Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!",0
883,"""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.""",0
883,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?",0
884,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?",0
884,"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.",0
884,Were never gonna find anybody.,0
884,Well then let me do it!,0

884,"I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!",0
884,Everyone knows Im an ass man!,0
884,That is true.,0
884,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.",0
884,Itll be me!,0
884,And I swear Ill do a really good job.,0
884,"Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.",0
884,It might be kinda cool.,0
884,So I can do it?,0
885,I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.,0
885,Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.,0
885,What the hell is that?,0
885,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",1
885,You said there was a gas leak in here.,0
885,Well why dont you use your key?,0
885,"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.",0
885,"If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.",0
885,Come on!,0
885,Hurry up.,0
885,Oh! We could have done that.,0
886,"Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.",0
886,"Oh, Im so sorry.",0
886,"Um, and maybe Im wrong!",0
886,"I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.",0
886,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?,1
886,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.",0
887,"Oh, but its made her so happy.",0
887,Little girl misses her cat.,0
887,Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.,0
887,"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",0
887,Yeah.,0
887,Thank you.,0
887,I,0

887,"Oh-no, hes right.",0
888,Seven hundred bucks!,0
888,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",0
888,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",0
888,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",0
888,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?",0
889,Oh.,0
889,Y'know those are a delicacy in India.,0
890,Me too.,0
890,"Although this city is my home, so.",0

900,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?,1
900,Alan.,0
900,He was unbelievable.,0
900,"He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...",0
900,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",0
900,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",0
900,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,0
900,What?,1
900,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",0
900,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",0
900,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",0
900,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,0
901,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,",0
901,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",0
901,What the hell!,1
901,Okay.,0
901,"All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?",0
901,"Yeah, this was a stupid idea.",0
902,My God!,1
902,These pants are burning up!,1
902,"Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!",1
902,What is she trying to kill me?,0
902,It's like a volcano in here!,1
902,Are you hot?,0
902,"Okay, it must just be me then.",0
902,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?",0
903,You're driving me crazy with that!,0
903,"Okay, I'll stop.",0
903,Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,0
903,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",0
903,You wanna play?,0
903,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.",0
903,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.,0
903,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",0
903,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",0
903,I'm intrigued.,0
903,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",0
903,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",0
903,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",0
903,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,0
903,"Uh yeah, right here.",0
904,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?",0
904,What's that?,0
904,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-",0
905,I'm sure they'll be here soon.,0
905,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.",0
905,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.,0
905,You are really frightening me.,0
905,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?",0
905,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go.",0
905,"All right, honey, time to start pushing.",0
905,But they're not here yet!,0
905,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.",0
905,"Oh, god.",0
906,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",0
906,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",0
906,"Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.",0
906,And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.,0
906,Okay.,0
906,"I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.",0
906,"Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?",0
906,So where-where is it going?,0
906,Ah!,1
906,Thats-thats the real question.,0
906,And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.,0
906,"Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.",0
906,"No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou",0
906,"Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?",0
907,Yknow what?,0
907,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.,0
907,I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .,0
907,No?,0
907,Really?,1
907,They taste so good.,0
908,Drum roll.,0
908,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",0
908,"Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",0
908,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",0
908,Youre actually going through with this?,1
908,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",0
908,"Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",0
908,You got problems because of you!,0
908,Not your name!,0
908,"All right, this has got to stop!",0
908,Chandler is a great name!,0
908,"In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.",0
908,"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.",0
909,Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!,1
909,It was.,0
910,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.",0
910,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?,1
910,No.,0
910,Whoa. That was really good.,1
910,"Thanks, any suggestions?",0
911,You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!,1
911,"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and",0
911,You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!,1
911,Well I was just so excited to see you.,0
911,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.,0
911,No-no its not!,0
911,I dont want to lose you!,0
911,Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.,0
911,So I guess this is it.,0
911,Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.,0
911,"Yeah, so do you.",0
912,Hey!,0
912,Hi.,0
912,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",0
912,Manhattan does not have enough stores.,0
912,"Well,",0
912,You can?,1
912,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,0
912,Um-hmm.,0
912,And a small piece of chocolate.,0
913,Okay.,0
913,"Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship",0
913,"I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!",0
913,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,0
913,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",0
913,"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",0
913,Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?,1
913,"No! No! Not, Paris.",0
913,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?",0
913,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!",0
913,When?,0
913,I dont know exactly.,0
913,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",0
913,But I do know that its some time tomorrow.,0
914,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!",0
914,Great! Go get him.,0
914,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",0
914,Hes not really my type.,0
914,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.",0
914,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",0
914,You do attract some stinkers.,0
915,Chandler.,0
915,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a",0
915,"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.",0
915,"Oh, listen.",0
915,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.",0
915,Really.,0
915,Nothing at all.,0
915,Really.,0
915,Nothing.,0
916,"Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",0
916,Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?,0
916,"No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.",0
916,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?",0
916,"No, no, I keep trying, yknow?",0
916,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom.""",0
916,He may think Im sick.,0
916,"Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!",0
916,"Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.",0
916,Thats it.,0
916,"Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?",0
916,Pretty much.,0
916,All right.,0
916,Hey Monica!,0
916,Hi!,0
916,"Hey man, you feeling any better?",0
916,"Joey, we have something to tell you.",0
916,Oh my God! Youre pregnant!,1
917,"Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.",0
917,What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.,0
917,Really?!,1
917,Yeah!,0
917,Oh my God!Eh! Well,1
918,"You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.",0
918,Hes gonna go up to the counter with,0
918,Yeah.,0

918,"So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?",0
919,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!,0
919,"Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",0
919,We will.,0
919,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",0
919,"No Mon,",0
919,Every year.,0
920,Hey! Ross!,0
920,Die Hard,0
920,"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?",0
920,Whatd you rent?,0
920,Die Hard 2,0
920,"Joey, this is",0
920,"Oh, well we watch it a second time and its",0

920,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.",0
920,"Well, John McClane had plans!",0
920,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",0
920,What are you talking about? Bitch.,0
921,I know you botched that operation on purpose.,0
921,"I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.",0
921,I don't care if you    are my brother.,0
922,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!",0
922,Stop going through my stuff !,0
922,Hey!,0
922,Hey!,0
922,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",0
922,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",0
922,"Please, what about you and Chandler?",0
922,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!,0
922,Well hello !,0
922,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?,0
922,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",0
922,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,0
922,I'm gonna do it.,0
922,And I can't stop you.,0
922,No.,0
922,"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?",0
922,I'm smarter than,0
923,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",0
923,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.",0
923,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.",0
923,"Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.",0
923,Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.,0
923,No.,0
923,"No, thank you.",0
923,"You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.",0
923,Id love an ice water.,0
923,You got it.,0
923,"Joey, what are you doing?",1
923,Just being friendly.,0
923,"Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.",0
923,"Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?",0
923,Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.,0
923,"Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",0
923,"Joey, do you work here?",1
923,No.,0
923,"Hey, waiter.",0
923,Yeah?,0
924,"Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.",0
924,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.",0
924,Im calling for Monica Geller.,0
924,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",0
924,"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!",1
925,Thank you.,0
925,Thanks.,0
925,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!,0
925,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am,0
925,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",0
925,So go fix it!,0
925,Go find Chandler!,0
925,He's probably up in your room!,0
925,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,0
925,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!,0
925,"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!",0
925,Anybody lose this?,0
925,Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!,0
925,Hmm.,0
926,Do you remember where the duck food is?,0
926,"Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?",1
926,Because Im going to London.,0
926,What?! What do you mean youre going to London?,1
926,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.",0
926,"Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.",0
926,"IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!",0
926,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.",0
926,But I have to tell him how I feel!,0
926,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.,0
926,Thats not why youre going!,0
926,"Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",0
926,"Forget that British chippy.""",0
926,OhhDo you think he will?!,1
926,No!,0
926,Because hes in love with the British chippy!,0
926,"Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!",0
926,"Yknow, its too late!",0
926,You missed youre chance!,0
926,"Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.",0
926,"Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, ""I do.""",0
926,"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.",0
927,So is everybody here?,0
927,I got here a little early myself.,0
927,Let us begin.,0
927,"Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.",0
927,Here.,0
927,Here.,0
927,Now as for the hydrosaurs,0
928,"Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.",0
928,"Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.",0
928,"So, do you think you can forgive me?",0
928,Great.,0
928,Thanks.,0
928,"Okay, bye.",0
928,"Hello, Jennifer?",0
928,"Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?",1
928,"Oh, shes not home huh?",1
928,"Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",0
929,Hey!,0
929,Hi.,0
929,Are you all right?,0
929,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,0
929,Oh my God! He did it?,1
929,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,0
929,Are you kidding?,1
929,I’m like the one who talked him into it.,0
929,I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,0
929,And you really think this is a good idea?,0
929,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.",0
929,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,0
929,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.",1
929,Really?! Even Ross?,1
929,Especially Ross!,0
929,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.",0
929,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.",1
929,"There he goes, your fiancée.",0
929,I guess so.,0
929,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,0
929,I can’t say that I’m surprised.,0
930,"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",0
930,What?,0
930,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.,0
930,"Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",0
930,You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.,0
930,"Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.",0
930,Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.,0
930,"Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.",0
930,I think on some levels she already knows.,0
931,Night Mon. Night Julio.,0
931,Adiós.,0
931,"Look Julio, someone left their book here.",1
931,"Ah actually, that is mine.",0
931,"Oh yeah, what are you reading?",0
931,"Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?",0
931,"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?",0
931,"I thought I would, but the translation's no good.",0
931,Your a poet and don't know it.,0
931,"Actually I ah, I am a poet.",0
931,"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?",0
931,"Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.",0
931,Mine?  Right here?,0
931,I can write an epic poem about this lip.,0
931,"How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",0
932,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.",0
932,What?,1
932,"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.",0
932,What?,1
932,Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?,0
932,Are we really in Montreal?!,1
932,"Yes we are. So, coffee?",0
932,"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",0
932,"Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.",0
933,"Okay, heres batch 22.",0
933,"Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.",0
933,"This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",0
933,Lets give it a shot.,0
933,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",1
933,"No, just a Friday night.",0
934,Would she?,0
934,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,0
935,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",0
935,"I know honey, Im sorry.",0
935,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.",0
935,"Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",0
935,"Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....",0
935,"I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",0
935,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,0
935,"Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....",0
935,"Its not funny, this is actually my job.",0
935,"Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.",0
935,"Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.",0
935,And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.,0
935,"Ah, just one other thing.",0
935,Yes?!,0
935,"I ah, I work at",0
935,Do you want my pickle?,0
936,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,0
936,Why?,1
936,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",0
936,Oh my God.,1
936,Phoebe.,0
936,"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.",0
936,"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.",0
936,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",0
936,We should do something. Whistle.,0
936,We are not going to whistle.,0
936,"Come on, do it.",0

936,Do it!,0
936,No!,0
936,Do it do it do it!,0
936,Woo-woo!,0
936,I can't believe you did that!,1
937,"Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.",0
937,Still?,1
937,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.",0
937,I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.,0
937,"Either eat it, or be in it.",0
937,"Spoon?  So, what do you think?",0
937,"Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.",0
937,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.,0
937,"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?",0
937,I can.,0
937,"Okay, go ahead.",0
937,"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.",0
937,"Thats very good, whats your name?",0
937,Monica.,0
937,"Monica, you go to the head of the class.",0
937,Okay.,0
938,"And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.",0
938,But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.,0
938,Human spleeeen.,0
938,Olé!,0
938,What are you doing here!,1
938,"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!",0

938,"It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!",0
938,"Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home"".",0
938,Listen Phoebe...,0
938,Yeah.,0
938,"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...",0
938,But what?,0
938,This is kind of a classy place.,0
938,"Ok, say no more.",0
939,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",0
939,"Well, I've brought some books. We could read.",0
939,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.",0
939,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!,0
939,"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention",0
939,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?",0
939,We can't. We're not pharmacists!,0

962,I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.,0
962,Oh right.,0
962,Right.,0
962,"Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?",0

962,"Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.",0
962,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.,0
962,"It took you that long to figure it out, huh?",1
962,"Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",0
963,Relax every muscle in your body.,0

963,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",0
963,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.",0
963,Okay.,0
963,"Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.",0
963,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....,0
963,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",0

966,She's supposed to be very good.,0
966,But what about Phoebe?,1
966,"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.",0
966,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.",0

967,Huh.,1
967,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",0
967,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",0
968,I cant believe you came back.,1
968,Dont say anything.,0
968,"I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.",0
968,"I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",0
968,Rachel! Rachel!,0

970,How?s it going.,0
970,This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.,0
970,What the hell?s a matter with you?,0
970,How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,0
970,"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.",0
970,"All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.",0
970,At least you know her name.,0
970,"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",0
970,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,0
970,Where in Cuba?,0
971,Hey.,0
971,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",0
971,Oh! I knew it! What happened?,1

972,Damn! I am good at Cups!,0
973,What? Why? Where are you?,1
973,Im still on the set!,0
973,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,0
973,"I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.",0
973,Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.,0
973,"No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.",0
973,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",0
973,Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!,0
974,Oh hey Joey! What's up?,0
974,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",0
974,"Yeah, I've been around.",0
974,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?",0
974,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.",0
974,Great! Problem solved!,0
975,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",0
975,"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.",0
975,Why?,1
975,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.",0
975,Bastard!,0
976,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!,1
976,All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!,1
976,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.",0
976,"Oh, I can't believe it!",1
976,I mean I think it's great!,0
976,For him.,0
976,She might be able to do better.,0
976,Hey guys!,0
976,Joey! Come here! Come here!,0
976,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,0
976,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?,0
976,"No. Joey, she",0
976,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",1
976,"Yes, but y'know what?",0
976,It doesn't matter who knows what.,0
976,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!",0
976,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!,0
977,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",0
978,"Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.",0
978,You really think it would be that different?,1
978,How could it not be?,1
978,"I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",0
978,And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a,0
978,"Well, things change.",0

978,Itll be okay Joe.,0
979,Its still there!,1
979,Mrs. Braverman must be out.,0
979,She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.,0
979,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",0
979,No that could kill her.,0
979,"Well, we dont want that.",0
979,"No, so were protecting her.",0
979,But we should take it.,0
979,But we should move quick.,0
979,Why?,1
979,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,0
979,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!,0
980,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",0
980,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,0
980,"Well, you're gonna.",0
980,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",0
980,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",0
980,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.",0
980,"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",0
980,"Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",0
980,"Hey, you're not him.",0
980,You're you.,0
980,"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",0
980,No.,0
980,No.,0
980,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.,0
980,"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!",0
980,"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""",0
980,You really think so?,0
980,Yeah. I really do.,0
980,"Thanks, Chandler.",0
980,Get off!,0
981,Hi.,0
981,"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?",0
981,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",0
981,And the cream?,0
981,Cheese makes me thirsty.,0
981,Okay. Lets move on.,0
981,All right.,0
981,Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?,1
981,Oh no!,1
981,I dont know anything about cooking.,0
981,"I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",0
981,"Well, hats off to the chef.",0
981,"I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",0
981,The chef!,0
981,Thats right.,0
982,"Hey, Pheebs.",0
982,Hey.,0
982,How's it going?,0
982,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,0
982,So what's going on?,0
982,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.",0
982,"I dunno, there's just something about...",0
982,Basically we just feel that he's...,0
982,We hate that guy.,0
982,Yeah. Hate him.,0
982,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",0
982,Uh-huh.,0
982,Okay.,0
982,"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",0
982,"...No, we hate him.",0
982,We're sorry.,0
983,Hey!,0
983,Hey!,0
983,What are you doing?,0
983,Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,0
984,Yes that was mine.,0
984,Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,0
984,Yes that would have made more sense.,0
984,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!",0
984,"All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.",0
984,"And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.",0
984,"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?",0
985,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",0
985,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",0
986,She said what?,1
986,"She said, ""If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""",0
986,Postpone it?,0
986,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?",0
986,"Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",0
986,This isnt right.,0
986,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.",0
986,I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,0
986,Dont you point your pants at me!,0
986,We have no choice!,0
986,"Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?",0
986,This is our wedding Im talking about.,0
986,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.,0
986,So what are you saying? Its now or never?,0
986,No. Im saying its now.,0
986,Or?,0
986,Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,0
986,Its not the pants.,0
986,Its you that is backwards.,0
986,"And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!",0
986,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please",0
987,"Hi, honey.",0
987,See you later.,0
987,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",0
987,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,0
987,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.",0
987,Oh no!,1
987,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",0
987,"Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!",0
987,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!,1
987,NOOOO!!!!!!!!,0
988,Ma! What're you doing here?,1
988,I came to give you this  and this.,0
988,Oww! Big ring!,1
989,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.",0
989,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",0
989,"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",0
989,Really?,1
989,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.",0
990,Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!,0
990,Have you ever seen so much crap?,0
990,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",0
990,Check this out. Can I have this?,0
991,What?,0
991,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.",0
991,"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.",0
991,"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",0
991,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",0
991,"Fortunately, it is me.",0
991,"And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.",0
991,"Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.",0
991,"Y'know, someplace nice.",0
991,"Yeah, someplace nice.",0
991,Yeah!,0
991,How much do you think I can get for my kidney?,0
992,"So, what do you think?",0
992,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,0
992,I know!,0
992,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?",0
992,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!",0
992,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!,0
993,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,0
993,Gotcha.,0
993,This place is really my Grandmothers.,0
993,"I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.",0
993,"So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.",0
993,So are you thirsty?,0
993,"Oh, you bet I am!",0
993,"Okay, heres your penis!",1
994,"Ohh, okay.",0
994,"Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.",0
994,"Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.",0
995,"Hey, ready for dinner?",0
995,"Ooh, absolutely!",0
995,Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?,0
995,"Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.",0
995,How about Mama Lisettie's?,0
995,Enh. Sure!,0
995,I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.,0
995,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!",0
995,Thatthis milk is mine.,0
995,"I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.",0
995,"Okay, let's go!",0
995,"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",0
995,But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.,0
995,"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!",0
995,"Okay, stop!",0
995,"Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?",0
995,"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",0
995,"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.",0
995,Thank you.,0
995,Go!,0
995,Go!,0
995,"Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.",0
996,"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!",0
996,No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!,0
996,I know. Im sorry.,0
996,All right fine! This looks like so much fun.,0
996,Yeah.,0
996,"God, what a mess.",0
997,"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",0
997,"Well, I lost.",0
997,"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",0
997,"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",0
997,Hey! Howd the interview go?,0
997,"Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.",0
997,"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.",0
997,Thats not how that was supposed to come out.,0
997,This is the worst Christmas ever.,0
997,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",0
997,I cant!,0
997,Its too late!,0
997,Terry already hired that girl over there.,0
997,"Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.",0
997,Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,0
997,That word was swans.,0
998,What do we got there?,1
998,"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!",1
998,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",0
998,It's all right.,0
998,It's all right.,0
998,You don't have to explain.,0
998,This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.,0
998,You're our third call tonight.,0
998,Really?,1
998,"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.",0
999,"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.",0
999,"No, you were right. I don't have a plan.",0
999,Thank God. Food.,0
999,Phoebe?,0
999,What?,0
999,Do you have a plan?,0
999,I don't even have a 'pl'.,0
999,"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",0
999,Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?',1
999,"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?",1
999,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?,0
999,And-and a power tie?,0
999,Oh God.,1
999,Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!,1

1006,I ate a bug.,0
1006,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.",0
1006,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.",0
1006,"Oh, now you want a favour?",0
1006,"Yes, please.",0
1006,"Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",0
1006,"Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.",0
1006,"No, Im not gonna pick them up.",0
1006,"Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.",0
1006,"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",0
1006,"No, Rachel doesnt want me to....",0
1006,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",0
1006,"Yeah, youre right.",0
1007,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",0
1007,"Oh, I know.",0
1007,I kinda feel like it's my fault.,0
1007,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,0
1007,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",0
1007,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",0
1007,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.",0
1007,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",0
1007,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",0
1007,"Okay, I admit it!",0
1007,I love this coat!,0
1007,"Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!",0
1007,Remember Phil Huntley?,0
1007,He was fine!,0
1008,So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!,0
1008,Oh no,0

1008,"Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",0
1008,I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out!,0
1008,"Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?",0

1008,"""We were on a break!""",0
1008,"""No we werent!""",0
1008,What happened to you two?,1
1009,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?",0
1009,I'm sorry.,0
1009,"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.",0
1009,"Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",0
1009,"Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.",0
1009,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the,1
1009,"I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.",0
1009,Is this because of the burrito thing?,0
1009,You need to give him money.,0
1009,Give him money? It was a joke!,1
1009,"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.",0
1009,"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.",0
1009,You've got to be smooth about it.,0
1009,"Hey, I can be smooth.",0
1009,"Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.",0
1009,"Of course, sir.",0
1009,Okay.,0
1010,Id better get back to my desk.,0
1010,"Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.",0
1010,My what?,1
1010,"Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.",0
1010,"But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.",0
1010,Are you serious?,1
1010,"No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",0
1011,I can blow dry it.,0
1011,I can put gel on it.,0
1011,"It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.",0
1011,Its so annoying.,0
1011,Does it bug you?,0
1011,You bug me.,0
1011,Is there any chance you didnt see that?,0
1012,"Hey Joey, what cha doing?",0
1012,Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?,0
1012,No.,0
1012,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,0
1012,"Joey, did",0
1012,Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.,0
1012,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?",1

1012,You found my book?!,0
1012,Yeah I did!,0
1012,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",0
1012,"Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!",1
1012,"Hey-hey, yknow what?",0
1012,Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.,0
1012,"Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",0
1012,You got porn!,0
1013,"Well, I feel like a snack!",0
1013,Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.,0
1013,Oh no thanks. I dont like,0
1013,What?!,1
1013,"Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",0
1013,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.",0
1013,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,0
1013,How did you know about that?!,1
1014,Hi!,0
1014,Hi!,0
1014,Come in.,0
1014,"Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and",0
1014,Great!,0
1014,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.",0
1014,"Okay, so I made up a little test.",0
1014,"Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",0

1015,"Monica, leave him alone",0
1015,Will you hurry up?,0
1015,Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?!,1
1015,And that theyre going to be drinking alot!,0
1015,"No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.",0
1015,Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?,0
1015,Joey!,0
1015,Come on!,0
1015,"I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?",0
1015,"This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?",0
1015,"So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",0
1015,Oh I am!,0
1015,"Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!",0
